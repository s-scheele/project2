This is the Raspberry Pi setup needed to run the programs!

You'll need:

 - OLED
 - LED with buttons
 - 3 LEDS (Red, Yellow, Green)
 - 3 resistors
 - 3 buttons
 - Breadboard
 - Approx 12 female / female wires
 - Approx 7 male / male wires
 - Approx 7 male / female wires

Now for the GPIO setup:

Breadboard:

led_yes = GPIO 21
led_enter = GPIO 16
led_no = GPIO 1
button_yes = GPIO 20
button_enter = GPIO 12
button_no = GPIO 7
Ground = Ground

LED with buttons:

STB = GPIO 14
CLK = GPIO 15
DIO = GPIO 18
UCC = 3.3V
GND = Ground

OLED:

GND = Ground
VDD = 3.3V
SCK = GPIO 11
SDA = GPIO 10
RES = GPIO 4
DC = GPIO 6
CS = GPIO 5


Libraries you'll need installed:

- paho.mqtt.client
- rpi_TM1638
- board
- digitalio
- PIL
- adafruit_ssd1306
- gpiozero
